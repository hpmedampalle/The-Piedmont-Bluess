# The-Piedmont-Blues

The Piedmont Blues is a musical genre that is composed of complex fingerpicking patterns applied to guitars. This type of guitar music got its rise in Durham, addressing social issues and sparking the emergence of many talented guitarists in North Carolina. The Piedmont Blues have a rich history, and its influence presides over even today’s music.

The rise of the tobacco industry was arguably the largest event in the history of the Piedmont Blues, as well as the most significant factor in its formation. The emergence of  tobacco warehouses and factories in North Carolina led to a large population of workers to form in Wake County, particularly in Durham. Much of the population practiced making Blue music in what would form into a distinct style known as ‘Piedmont Blues.’ The factory workers provided a large audience for the music, and the genre grew immensely.

As Jim Crow laws came to tuition, Piedmont Blues provided an outlet for African American musicians to express their grievances. The lyrics often were a testimony to the struggles and mistreatment that black Americans faced.

The serious subject matter of the lyrics, alongside the eccentric style that other Piedmont Blues musicians took on, which many viewed as crass, led to dissent of the genre by church-goers.  The Piedmont Blues contributed to religious individuals labeling forms of guitar music as ‘satanic.’ One musician of the genre, Josh White, integrated social commentary on segregation into his music. As a result of his lyricism, White would be interrogated by the FBI on suspicions of communism, despite not holding said beliefs. White appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee to clear his name. White would defend the use of music to address social injustice by reading to the committee the lyrics of Strange Fruit, one of his most famous recordings, in which lyrics were adapted from an anti-lynching poem of the same name. The song would make its way into the Congressional Record.

Despite its great historical value, much of the most Piedmont most prominent music was never recorded. The genre was experienced by people first hand. They  would play at gatherings on farms, picnics, on the street, in Black-owned businesses, and most notably, at the tobacco auctions that helped make Durham a center of gravity for this music.

The included images show the conditions that led to the formation of Piedmont blues, as well as the social issues that influenced the subject matter of the lyrics. In addition, they also convey the connectedness brought by it. The music centered around the live performances rather than recordings, and it is imperative that stress is placed on the value of the social aspect. 


There are many existing personal accounts from Piedmont blues musicians, all of which are informative of their experience, and what Piedmont blues meant for them. A UNC Chapel hill interview was conducted with the late James “Guitar Slim” Stephens, a Carolina Blues pioneer who stressed the music’s importance and place in modern times. The PBS NC program Folkways aired an episode documenting Piedmont Blues.


The biggest key to understanding Piedmont Blues is listening to the music that shaped the genre; from there you can properly see its style, as well as its history's influence on it. The lyricism of popular Piedmont Blues songs consisted of themes of prison and travel. These themes were reflective of the conditions of a segregated south. 

The most prominent pioneers of the Piedmont Blues were musicians Blind Boy Fuller, and his mentor, Blind Blake. Many prominent guitarists have emerged from Piedmont Blues, and others have drawn influence from it. The band Pink Floyd would draw inspiration from, and find its name in Floyd Council, a prominent Piedmont Blues musician from Chapel Hill, alongside South Carolinian bluesman Pink Anderson. 

The Piedmont blues is of great importance to North Carolina music and culture. Not only did it shape the music of today, it also held great historical significance in its social commentary and connection brought by it.
